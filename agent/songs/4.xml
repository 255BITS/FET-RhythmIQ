  <avoid>darkness, light, power</avoid>
  <uses>[Foot stomps], [Whispers], [Body percussion]</uses>
  <starts>Rhythmic breathing</starts>
  <lyrics>
Quiet steps on wooden floors
Shadow moves through slamming doors
Never seen but always felt
Strength that's built where knees have knelt

In the spaces no eyes trace
Beats the heart they can't erase
Silent rhythm finds its way
Shadow dance at break of day

Echoes form in empty hall
Wall to wall the pattern calls
Unseen feet mark ancient beat
Hidden pulse makes life complete

  <style>Upbeat acoustic</style>
  <negative_style>Electronic effects</negative_style>
