Starts: Harbor bell

Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Harbor bell through evening mist  
Waves slap docks where no ship exists  
Chain drops with rusty twist  
Night watch keeps its lonely list

Chorus:  
Wave crash (echo crash crash)  
Moon hides (echo hides hides)  
Harbor keeps its ancient tryst  
Wind sings through metal grist

Verse 2:  
Compass spins with nowhere left  
Chart shows reefs we've long since missed  
Drink up this empty chest  
Yo ho ho through midnight mist

[Foghorn blast]

Style: Industrial harbor chant
Negative Style: Clean production
