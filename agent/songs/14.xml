  <lyrics>
Thump-thump goes the night
Feet stamp left, hands clap right
Cheek pressed to concrete ground
Hear the world's true sound

Boom-boom primitive beat
Pulse beneath working feet
Breath huffs mark time complete
This is how worlds complete

Knuckle crack on steel rail
Rust choir sings our tale
Lung hum joins machine wail
Flesh and iron prevail

Thump-thump never dies
Rhythm's birth in human cries
  </lyrics>
