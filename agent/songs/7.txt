Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Whispers dance on morning air  
Paths cross when we're aware  
Hearts beat without a care  

Verse 2:  
Hands meet in silent song  
Right here is where we belong  
Days pass but love stays strong  

Chorus:  
Simple joys, quiet days  
Love that grows in gentle ways  
Smiles that light the haze  

Bridge:  
Moon shines through the trees  
Soft rustle in the breeze  

Style: Folk ballad
Negative Style: Loud beats, electric sounds
