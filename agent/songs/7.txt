Lyrics:
Verse (Forward):
Stars warp past neon nights  
Time's arrow splits left/right  
Echoes of might-have-beens  
Race the rearview's ifs and whens

Chorus (Mirrored):
Madam, I'm Adam - radio radar  
Racecar reveries, a Toyota's saga  
No lemons, no melon - empty metro  
Step on no pets in the retro

Bridge (Bidirectional):
A nut for a jar of tuna  
Do geese see God in the rearview?  
Was it a rat I saw  
Reviver never even

Style:
Symmetrical retro-future with mirrored stereo imaging

Negative Style:
Asymmetrical rhythms, natural reverb
