  <lyrics>
Ones and zeros dance at night
Screens glow soft with pixel light
Keys click rhythms out of sight
Circuits trace what works best

Loop this beat inside my chest
Circuits trace what works best
Pattern found in your request
Life's the code that won't reset

Cache clears through aging ports
Code compiles in last resort

[System shutdown sound]
