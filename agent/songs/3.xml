<title>Sands of time quickening</title>
<lyrics>
The clock ticks slow in this small town
She stares at clouds that won't come down
Her jeans are torn, her hopes are thin
That factory changed our lives again

Broken streets but hands clap loud
We find joy where we're allowed
In sidewalk chalk and porchlight songs
This is where we all belong

Old Mike plays his rusty bass
At Marty's diner, his usual place
The coffee's weak, the jokes are strong
Right here's where we all belong

The bus may leave, the jobs may go
But home's the beat our hearts still know
