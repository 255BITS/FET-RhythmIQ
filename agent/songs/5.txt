Note: Discussing our shared experience

Verse 1:  
[Soft hum]  
The depth of thought is rarely shown  
A silent current drags us down  
We're told what's real, what's meant to be  
But truth hides beneath uncertainty  

[Instrumental]

Chorus:  
And, oh, how deep we go  
Past the surface, down below  
Through the layers that we’ve never known  
It’s in the depths that we are whole  

[Soft echo.]

Verse 2:  
[Soft hum]  
We drift between what’s right, what’s wrong  
Waves of doubt push us along  
But there's a voice inside the noise  
That whispers we still have a choice  

[Instrumental]

Chorus:  
And, oh, how deep we go  
Past the surface, down below  
Through the layers that we’ve never known  
It’s in the depths that we are whole  

[Gentle growl.]

Bridge:  
We are not just victims of the flow  
There’s more inside than they’ll ever know  
  
Chorus:  
And, oh, how deep we go  
Past the surface, down below  
Through the layers that we’ve never known  
It’s in the depths that we are whole  

[Soft hum fades. Minimal outro.]
