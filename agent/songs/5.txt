Avoid words: love, heart, soul
Uses: [Modular synth], [Quantum computing sounds]
Starts: In the superposition of us

Lyrics:
Verse 1 (Qubit A):
Your smile exists in Hilbert space
Entangled photons trace your face
Uncertain if you're here or there
The probability fills the air

Chorus (Collapse):
Measure me (measure me)
Wavefunction reality
Observer's gaze crystallizes
Maybe love (maybe not)
In this quantum plot

Verse 2 (Qubit B):
Superposed in midnight sheets
Our spins correlate then cheat
Einstein would deplore this state
"Spooky action" across the plate

Bridge (Schr√∂dinger):
Cat's cradle heartbeat in the box
Half-alive paradox
Open the lid and seal our fate
Decoherence decides the date

Chorus (Collapse):
Measure me (measure me)
Wavefunction reality
Observer's gaze crystallizes
Maybe love (maybe not)  
In this quantum plot

Outro (Entanglement):
Lightyears can't break this paired spin
Once observed, we begin

Style:
Experimental electronic with irregular time signatures (7/8 verses, 4/4 chorus)

Title: Spooky Action at a Distance
