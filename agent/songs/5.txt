Your smile lights the morning sky  
Birds sing as clouds drift by  
Simple joys that never lie

Hold my hand, walk with me  
Through fields and over sea  
Together we will always be

Laughter rings through summer rain  
Sun returns to dry the pain  
Love remains through joy and strain

Moonlight on still water  
Peace we always wanted
