  <lyrics>
Steel meets nail with steady beat
Hands build what minds conceive
Wood shaped by honest skill
Workshop hums and never still

Hammers ring in morning air
Craft made with patient care
Tools worn but still precise
Pride forged in work we share

Day begins with tools in hand
Building things that truly stand
