  <lyrics>
Moonlight paints the empty street
Shadows mark where workers meet
Echoes of hammers fill the air
Proof of hands that built with care

Circle round the worksite fire
Shared resolve burns ever higher
Hands worn rough but spirits true
Night shift crew sees morning through

Streetlights watch the loading dock
Wind carries the shift bell's knock
Time moves on but pride remains
In steel beams that frame our names

Cranes trace paths in morning light
Day shift starts the cycle right
