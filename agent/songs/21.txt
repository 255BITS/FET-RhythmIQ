Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Mix words like flour in a bowl  
Beat rhymes smooth - no lumpy soul  
Knead lines till rhythms roll  
Let dough rise in time's warm bowl  

Chorus:  
Bake it long, bake it through  
Timer dings when cooked through  
Lyric pie fresh for you  
Secret spice - care's quiet glue  

Verse 2:  
Cool down on window sill  
Verse crust cracks but flavors thrill  
Share slices with those who hear  
Shared bread calms daily fears  

Bridge:  
Oven light burns through night  
Songs rise best when kneaded right
