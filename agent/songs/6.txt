Lyrics:  
Do lines call when lights stay low?
Moon whispers things we used to know
Can memories fade like old songs go?
Do lines hum when lights stay low?
 
Numbers dance in midnight air
Counting beats of hearts laid bare
Do lines hum when lights stay low?
Moon whispers things we used to know

Time spins round like old records play
Love stays bright though threads fray
Hold tight to what light remains
Morning comes to heal old pains

Do wires hum when lights go low?
Moon whispers things we used to know

Style:
Soft electronic with piano

Negative Style:
Loud beats, complex rhythms

Title: Night Whispers
