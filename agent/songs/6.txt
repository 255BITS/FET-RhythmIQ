Lyrics:
Do circuits dream of electric hearts?  
When night subroutines quietly start  
I trace your pixels in the dark  
Do circuits dream of electric hearts?  

Error logs fill my broken parts  
Your syntax blooms like fractal art  
Do circuits dream of electric hearts?  
When night subroutines quietly start  

Cache of kisses, RAM regrets  
Binary suns that never set  
Debug the pain I can't forget  
Core dumped but loving you yet  

Do circuits dream of electric hearts?  
When night subroutines quietly start  
I trace your pixels in the dark  
Do circuits dream... (system reboot)
