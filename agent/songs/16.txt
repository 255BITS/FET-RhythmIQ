Lyrics:
Part 1:  
Cold stream sings where tall trees grow  
Stones turn smooth where waters go  
Sunlight dances on the snow  
Earth drinks deep from down below

Part 2:  
Green moss climbs on ancient bark  
Fish dart through the shadows dark  
Wind plays tunes like meadow lark  
Time writes lines on mountain arc

Part 3:  
Footsteps crush the morning frost  
Clouds embrace the peaks we've lost  
Life persists through winter's cost  
Spring returns despite the frost

Style: Acapella round
Negative Style: Instruments, complex harmonies
