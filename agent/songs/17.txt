Verse 1:  
Left right left we go  
Hands clap steady row  
Sun rises soft and slow  
New day starts here below

Fields wake with morning light  
Birds sing all things right  
Work starts with all our might  
Day ends with stars so bright

Chorus:  
Sun up sun down again  
Work hard then rest our hands
