Avoid words: firewall, algorithm, binary
Uses: [Modular synth glitches], [Vigen√®re cipher rhythms], [RSA keychange sweeps]
Starts: Prime number heartbeat
Note: Verse syllable counts follow prime numbers (2,3,5,7 per line)

Lyrics:
Verse 1 (Encryption):
Your eyes broadcast in plaintext
While mine run SHA-256 complex
We dance in XOR twilight
One-time pad paradox

Chorus (Key Exchange):
Diffie-Hellman midnight handshake
Elliptic curve where our palms make
A shared secret symphony
Prime modulus intimacy

Verse 2 (Ciphertext):
Steganographic whispers hide
In least significant bits of night
Traceroute kisses timeout
SSH tunnels sealed shut tight

Bridge (Cryptanalysis):
Meet-in-middle birthday attack
Our hashes collide no going back
Salt the wounds with random seed
Broken cipher, planted weed

[Rot13 breakdown: Melody transposes +13 semitones then inverts]

Style:
Post-quantum folk - mandolin vs modular synth (7/11 time)

Title: Symmetric Key Lullaby
