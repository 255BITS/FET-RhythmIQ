Lyrics:
Verse 1 (1710):  
Quill scratches parchment concert A  
Harpsichord springs keep courtly time  
Your minuet traces my heart's crime  
In parallel fifths we disobey  

Chorus (3030):  
Δt = 0 → Meet me where tenses collide  
You're my phase shift, my causal tide  
Tide causal my, shift phase my You're  
Collide tenses where me Meet ← 0 = tΔ  

Verse 2 (1710⁻¹):  
Disobey we fifths parallel In  
Crime heart's my traces minuet Your  
Time courtly keep springs Harpsichord  
A concert parchment scratches Quill  

Bridge (1440):  
Press (Gutenberg) our lips to type  
Each (moveable) kiss in leaden night  
Matrix (rhymes) with inky flesh  
Tomorrow's Bible: Our score enmeshed
