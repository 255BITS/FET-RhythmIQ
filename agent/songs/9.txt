Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Old bell shadows mark our rhyme  
Your walk plays forward, mine rewinds  
Each step echoes through hollow years  
We dance apart yet somehow near  
 
Chorus:  
Meet me where past meets tomorrow  
In the space between joy and sorrow  
Your hand in mine across the years  
Time's river bends but disappears  

Verse 2:  
Mirror images face to face  
Yesterday's smile, tomorrow's grace  
The music swells then fades away  
We find our rhythm in delay  

Bridge:  
Chimes collide in midnight air  
Two hearts beat as one pair  

Style: 
Simple waltz - piano (3/4 time)
Negative Style: Electronic beats, complex rhythms

Title: Across the Hours
