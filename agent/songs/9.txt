Lyrics:
Verse 1:
Work bell marks the morning time
Your drill spins while my saw climbs
Each shift echoes through these walls
We build strong though seldom cross

Chorus:  
Meet where shift change overlaps
Passing tools in silent swaps
Your wrench fits where mine falls short
Teamwork makes the effort sport

Verse 2:  
Workers pass through factory gates  
Shared nods across divided states  
The music swells then fades away  
We find our pace in work delay  

Style: 
Simple waltz - piano (3/4 time)

Negative Style:
Electronic beats, complex rhythms

Title: Across the Hours
