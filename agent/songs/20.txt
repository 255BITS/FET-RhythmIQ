Verse 1:  
One clap starts the pattern true  
Two feet stamp the rhythm through  
Three strings hum what hands undo  
Four walls echo songs anew

Chorus:  
Begin where final notes repeat  
First note rings with final beat  
Turn the page repeat repeat  
Circle round but stay complete

Verse 2:  
Five lights glow on empty stage  
Six hearts write the final page  
Seven turns of timeless age  
Eight hands close the looping cage
