Verse 1 (Thylakoid Dawn):  
Five photons kiss chlorophyll  
Eight electrons climb waterfall hill  
Thirteen nanograms of glucose made

H₂O cracks like morning ice  
Oxygen exhale pays the price

Rubisco dances with CO₂

ATP synthase spins moonlit true  
Dark reactions craft morning's hue

Five degrees between light and shade  
Eight guard cells trade water for trade  
Thirteen cycles make one sugar's weight

Succulent beats quench night's thirst
