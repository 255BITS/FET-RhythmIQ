Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Morning light wakes sleeping trees  
Dew drops dance in gentle breeze  
Nature hums its quiet song  
World feels right where we belong
 
Chorus:  
Sun and rain take turns to play  
Night gives way to brighter day  
Seasons turn but love stays true  
Growing old while staying new  

Verse 2:  
Rivers flow to distant seas  
Carrying hopes like fallen leaves  
Though the path may twist and bend  
Journey matters in the end  

Outro:  
Moon rises soft and slow  
Peaceful night, calm we know
