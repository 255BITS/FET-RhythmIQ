Lyrics:
Verse 1: The sun peeks through the morning haze
Birds compose their serenades
Footsteps echo on the street
Strangers' eyes sometimes meet

Chorus: In the pattern of days
We see love in simple ways
Stitching moments as we go
In these times, we learn to grow

Verse 2: Children chase the setting sun
Laughter rings, the day's undone
Old friends gather, stories told
Hearts connected, breaking mold

[Whistling Solo]

Chorus: In the tapestry of days
We see love in simple ways
Stitching moments as we go
In these times, we learn to grow

Bridge: Underneath the same vast sky
Dreams ignite and hopes fly high

Chorus: In the tapestry of days
We see love in simple ways
Stitching moments as we go
In these times, we learn to grow

Outro: Stars emerge as night unfolds
In our hearts, a story told
