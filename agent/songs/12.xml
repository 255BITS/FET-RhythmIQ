  <lyrics>
Morning light wakes sleeping trees
Dew drops dance in gentle breeze
Fields hum their workday song
World feels right where we belong

Sun and rain take turns to play
Night gives way to brighter day
Seasons turn but life stays true
Growing old while staying new

Rivers flow to distant seas
Carrying hopes like fallen leaves
Though the path may twist and bend
Journey matters in the end

Moon rises soft and slow
Peaceful night, calm we know
