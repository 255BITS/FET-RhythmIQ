Lyrics:
Verse 1:
With a heart full of hope and eyes wide
She sets off to embrace the tide
The path ahead, unknown and long
Her ancestors' whispers, her guiding song

Chorus:
Silent stones mark the switchback turns
Each scar a map where the lantern burns
Not chasing - becoming the flame
The mountain knows no hero's name

Verse 2:
Calloused hands grip tomorrow's thread
Weaving through rock where eagles dread
No summit claimed, no flag unfurled
The transformation shapes the world

Chorus:
Silent stones mark the switchback turns
Each scar a map where the lantern burns
Not chasing - becoming the flame
The mountain knows no hero's name

Bridge:
Quarter-inch increments etch the climb
Friction between what's held and what's timed
The metamorphosis none can see -
She's both the sculptor and the sea

Chorus:
Silent stones mark the switchback turns
Each scar a map where the lantern burns
Not chasing - becoming the flame
The mountain knows no hero's name

Style:
Folk-pop, clear and enchanting voice, uplifting, feel-good, and inspiring

Negative Style:
rock and roll, cheesy, boring

Title:
Embrace the Journey
