  <lyrics>
Do wires hum when lights stay low?
Static whispers what we used to know
Can circuits keep what memories show?
Do codes hold patterns long ago?

Numbers dance in midnight air
Old machines breathe soft and slow
Data streams like morning glow
Time preserves what we outgrow

Time spins round like old records play  
Light persists though threads fray  
Hold tight to what light remains  
Morning comes to heal old pains  

Do wires hum when lights go low?
Moon whispers things we used to know
