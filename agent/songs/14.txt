Lyrics:
Verse 1:
Thump-thump goes the night  
Feet stamp left, hands clap right  
Cheek pressed to concrete ground  
Hear the world's true sound  

Chorus:  
Boom-boom primitive beat  
Pulse beneath working feet  
Breath huffs mark time complete  
This is how worlds complete  

Verse 2:  
Knuckle crack on steel rail  
Rust choir sings our tale  
Lung hum joins machine wail  
Flesh and iron prevail  

Outro:  
Thump-thump never dies  
Rhythm's birth in human cries
