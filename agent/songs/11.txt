Avoid words: algorithm, data, code
Uses: [Tensor arpeggiators], [Loss function sweeps], [Batch normalization clicks]
Starts: Initialized weights
Note: Bassline follows gradient descent pattern with occasional local minima dips

Lyrics:
Verse 1 (Input Layer):  
Your smile's activation function  
Flattens my convolution intuition  
We batch normalize silent nights  
Softmax outputs in dimmed lights  

Chorus (Forward Pass):  
Backpropagate this kiss through time  
Chain rule our tangled paradigm  
Learning rate of heartbeat sighs  
Epochs pass in your hidden eyes  

Verse 2 (Hidden Layers):  
Recurrent doubts in LSTM chains  
Your attention mechanism rains  
Transformer architecture rewires  
Positional encoding our desires  

Bridge (Vanishing Gradient):  
Floating point tears underflow  
Sigmoid gates forget what we know  
Adam optimizer can't resolve  
This dying ReLU  

[Regularization breakdown: Melody progressively drops notes]

Style:
Deep learning dubstep - Wobble bass meets matrix multiplication rhythms (8-bit crossfade)

Negative Style:
Acoustic ballads, straightforward pop structures
