Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
The clock ticks slow in this small town  
She stares at clouds that won't come down  
Her jeans are torn, her hopes are thin  
That factory changed our lives again
 
Chorus:  
Broken streets but hands clap loud  
We find joy where we're allowed  
In sidewalk chalk and porchlight songs  
This is where we all belong

Verse 2:  
Old Mike plays his rusty bass  
At Marty's diner, his usual place  
The coffee's weak, the jokes are strong  
Right here's where we all belong

Outro:  
The bus may leave, the jobs may go  
But home's the beat our hearts still know

Style:
Americana folk

Negative Style:
Electronic beats, synth pads

Title: Porchlight People
