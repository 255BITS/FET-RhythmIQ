Lyrics:
Verse 1:
Concrete blossoms push through asphalt veins (uh-huh)
Subway poets spit encrypted refrains (decrypt this)
My kicksoles slap metro tile mantras
We're all beta testing life's patch notes
 
Chorus:
Neon flickers on rain-slicked code
We glitch together on this overload
No final boss, just endless spawn
We level up each dusk till dawn

Verse 2:
Fire escapes become treble clef stairs (watch your step)
Graffiti constellations map out prayers
My breath syncs to brownstone heartbeat
The city's chorus - incomplete

Chorus:
Neon flickers on rain-slicked code
We glitch together on this overload
No final boss, just endless spawn
We level up each dusk till dawn

Verse 3:
Scaffold symphonies in 6/8 time (tick-tock)
Rusted dreams still nickel-and-dime
My rhyme book's spine cracks like sidewalks
Every chapter - another paradox

[Drop: 8 measures of intense and fast rap with a complex rhyme scheme]
Metronome lungs beatbox the night (pfft-pfft)
Streetlight confetti in mid-flight (catch it)
We're all broken karaoke screens
Belting truths through static seams
Concrete gardens, razorwire vines
Our voices warp where powerlines
Don't look down - pavement sings spring
Subway vents exhale beginnings

Chorus:
Neon flickers on rain-slicked code
We glitch together on this overload
No final boss, just endless spawn
We level up each dusk till dawn
