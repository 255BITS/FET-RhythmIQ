Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Steel meets nail with steady beat  
Hands build what minds conceive  
Wood shaped by honest skill  
Workshop hums and never still

Verse 2:  
Hammers ring in morning air  
Craft made with patient care  
Tools worn but still precise  
Pride forged in work we share

Chorus:  
Day begins with tools in hand  
Building things that truly stand

Workshop rhythm
