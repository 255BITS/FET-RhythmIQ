  <lyrics>
Harbor bell through evening mist
Waves slap docks where no ship exists
Chain drops with rusty twist
Night watch keeps its lonely list

Wave crash (echo crash crash)
Moon hides (echo hides hides)
Harbor keeps its ancient tryst
Wind sings through metal grist

Compass spins with nowhere left
Chart shows reefs we've long since missed
Drink up this empty chest
Yo ho ho through midnight mist

[Foghorn blast]
