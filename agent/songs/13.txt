Avoid words: spiral, infinite, copy
Uses: [Mandelbrot basslines], [Recursive vocal loops], [Golden ratio tempo shifts]
Starts: Seed value whispers
Note: Chorus lyric structure follows Sierpiński triangle pattern (1,3,9,27 words per line)

Lyrics:
Verse 1 (Iteration 0):
Base case hearts in initial state
Your boundary condition defines my fate
Empty set nights with singleton dreams
While loop arms in linked list streams

Chorus (Strange Attractor):
Fold
Me into your julia set
Each kiss branches to three then nine
Twenty-seven reasons to call this love divine while maintaining Hausdorff dimension between our timelines

Verse 2 (Iteration N+1):
Your lips solve my recurrence relation
Complex roots bloom in conjugate formation
We converge where phase spaces align
Fixed point souls in continuous time

Bridge (Fractal Breakdown):
Peano curve through our shared bed
Cantor dust where promises spread
Non-orientable morning after
Möbius strip of love and laughter

[Recursive Outro: Final chorus line repeats while pitch-shifting down by golden ratio]

Style:
Mathcore ballad - piano morphing into fractal noise (φ time signature)
Negative Style: Linear structures, 4/4 beats
