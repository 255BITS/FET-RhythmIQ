Verse 1:  
Morning sun through window shines  
Breakfast smells and coffee lines  
Simple joys these hearts entwine

Love grows in simple ways  
Through ordinary days  
Smiles shared in morning haze

Evening walks hand in hand  
Quiet talks understand  
Roots grow where we stand

Moonlight on sleeping town  
Hearts beat without a sound
