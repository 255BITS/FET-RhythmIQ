Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Quiet steps on wooden floors  
Shadow moves through slamming doors  
Never seen but always felt  
Strength that's built where knees have knelt

Chorus:  
In the spaces no eyes trace  
Beats the heart they can't erase  
Silent rhythm finds its way  
Shadow dance at break of day

Verse 2:  
Echoes form in empty hall  
Wall to wall the pattern calls  
Unseen feet mark ancient beat  
Hidden pulse makes life complete

Style: Upbeat acoustic
Negative Style: Electronic effects
