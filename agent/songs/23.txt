Lyrics:
Verse 1:
Ones and zeros dance at night  
Screens glow soft with pixel light  
Keys click rhythms out of sight  
Circuits trace what works best

Chorus: 
Loop this beat inside my chest  
Circuits trace what works best  
Pattern found in your request  
Life's the code that won't reset

Bridge:  
Cache clears through aging ports  
Code compiles in last resort  

[System shutdown sound]

Style:
Glitch pop

Negative Style:
Organic instruments
