  <lyrics>
Cold stream sings where tall trees grow
Stones turn smooth where waters go
Sunlight dances on the snow
Earth drinks deep from down below

Green moss climbs on ancient bark
Fish dart through the shadows dark
Wind plays tunes like meadow lark
Time writes lines on mountain arc

Footsteps crush the morning frost
Clouds embrace the peaks we've lost
Life persists through winter's cost
Spring returns despite the frost
