  <lyrics>
Work bell marks the morning time
Your drill spins while my saw climbs
Each shift echoes through these walls
We build strong though seldom cross

Meet where shift change overlaps
Passing tools in silent swaps
Your wrench fits where mine falls short
Teamwork makes the effort sport

Workers pass through factory gates
Shared nods across divided states
The music swells then fades away
We find our pace in work delay
