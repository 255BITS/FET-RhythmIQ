Lyrics:
Verse 1:  
Moonlight paints the silent street  
Our shadows dance where memories meet  
Echoes of laughs still linger here  
Whispers of love I still hear  

Chorus:  
Circle round like old records play  
Night holds things we can't say  
Hearts beat in familiar ways  
Love remains through passing days  

Verse 2:  
Streetlights blink their tired eyes  
Wind carries forgotten sighs  
Time moves on but something stays  
In this place where we once played  

Outro:  
Moon keeps watch through the night  
Guiding stars feel just right  

Style: Night pop
Negative Style: Loud instruments
Title: Night Circles
