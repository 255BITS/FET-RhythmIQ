Avoid words: gravity, stars, universe
Uses: [Space ambient pads], [Pulsar beats], [Theremin melodies]
Starts: Event horizon whispers
Note: Lyric structure follows orbital mechanics - verses decay into choruses like decaying orbits

Lyrics:
Verse 1 (Perihelion):
Your event horizon whispers in hydrogen lines
Accretion disk eyes refract the time
We oscillate in Lagrange points
Tidal locked hearts beating out of joint

Chorus (Escape Velocity):
Singularity blues in 3/4 spin
Redshift promises leaking from our skin
We're hyperbolic comets you and I
Burning bright but never touching sky

Verse 2 (Aphelion):
Dark matter hands map my celestial skin
Your asteroid belt where I begin
We calculate love in Planck lengths
Entropy wins but we still cling

Bridge (Orbital Decay):
Chromatic aberration blues
Every spectrum leads back to you
Asynchronous orbits decay
We're just cosmic background noise anyway

Style: 
Astronomical Americana - pedal steel meets radio telescope signals (6/8 to 4/4 transitions)

Title: Kepler's Blues
