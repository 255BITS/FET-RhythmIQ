Lyrics:
Verse 1:
Moonlight paints the empty street
Shadows mark where workers meet
Echoes of hammers fill the air
Proof of hands that built with care

Chorus:  
Circle round the worksite fire
Shared resolve burns ever higher
Hands worn rough but spirits true
Night shift crew sees morning through

Verse 2:  
Streetlights watch the loading dock
Wind carries the shift bell's knock
Time moves on but pride remains
In steel beams that frame our names

Outro: Cranes trace paths in morning light  
Day shift starts the cycle right  

Style: Night pop
Negative Style: Loud instruments
Title: Night Circles
