Compose a song about submarine explorers discovering a bioluminescent civilization. Structure must mirror a dive profile with increasing pressure.

Song:
Uses: [Sonar pings], [Hydrophone field recordings], [Depth-charge kicks]
Structure: 
- Verse 1 (0-200m) -> Chorus (Discovert) 
- Verse 2 (200-4000m) -> Pressure Drop Breakdown
- Verse 3 (Abyssal plain) -> Chorus (Distorted)
Constraints:
- Lyrics incorporate actual deep-sea biology terms (chemosynthesis, hadal zone)
- Melody becomes progressively more compressed/distorted with depth
