Compose a multilingual round where each verse cycles through different languages. Melody must adapt phonetics to each tongue while maintaining harmonic continuity.

Song:
Uses: [Polyrhythmic percussion], [Linguistic morphing synths], [Binaural panning]
Structure: Verse 1 (Mandarin) → Verse 2 (Swahili) → Verse 3 (Nahuatl) → Unified chorus (All three)
Constraints: 
- Each verse must use authentic idiomatic expressions
- Transition between languages should feel phonetically inevitable
- Final chorus combines all three languages grammatically

Example approach:
"Moonlight" becomes "Yuèguāng" (月光) → "Mwangaza wa mwezi" → "Metztli"
