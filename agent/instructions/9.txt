Create a song where romantic tension is expressed through neural network architecture metaphors. Structure must mirror deep learning layers with vanishing gradient problems in the bridge.

Song:
Uses: [Activation function synth stabs], [Overfitting vocal harmonies], [GPU fan noise percussion]
Structure: 
- Verse 1 (Input Layer) -> Chorus (Forward Propagation)
- Verse 2 (Hidden Layers) -> Dropout Bridge 
- Final Chorus (Model Convergence)
Constraints:
- Lyrics must include actual ML terms (epochs, weights, ReLU)
