Compose a song using periodic table elements as metaphors for relationship stages. Each verse represents a different element group's chemical properties.

Song:
Uses: [Alkali metal beats], [Noble gas synth pads], [Transition metal brass]
Structure: Verse 1 (Alkali) -> Chorus -> Verse 2 (Noble) -> Chorus -> Bridge (Halogen) -> Double-time breakdown (Actinides)
Constraint: Chorus must include actual elemental properties (e.g. valence electrons, reactivity)
Note: Create rhythmic patterns mirroring atomic mass sequences
