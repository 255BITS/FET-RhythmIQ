Description:
An adventure into the wild; we hold on tight, no need to say


*Verse 1:*  
I heard the winds calling my name  
Soft whispers brush across the flame  
These roads we walk, they twist and bend  
But every corner shows the end  

*Pre-Chorus:*  
Ooo-aaa, hearts never fade   
Ooo-aaa, but they shift like the shade  

*Chorus:*  
We run till we find where the wild begins  
We lose, we grow, we make our amends  
Through joy and tears that carve our way  
We hold on tight, no need to say aaa-aa  
No need to say aaa-aa  

*Verse 2:*  
You left your mark, like stars in the dark  
But shadows still wander through the park  
I won't forget, but I'll move ahead  
Some things stay, even when they're dead  

*Pre-Chorus:*  
Ooo-aaa, hearts never break  
Ooo-aaa, only learn to ache  

*Chorus:*  
We run till we find where the wild begins  
We lose, we grow, we make our amends  
Through joy and tears that carve our way  
We hold on tight, no need to say aaa-aa  
No need to say aaa-aa  

*Bridge:*   
With every fall, I find the sky  
In every sorrow, we learn why  
Ooo, can’t deny  
Oo-oo, we all try  

*Chorus:*  
We run till we find where the wild begins  
We lose, we grow, we make our amends  
Through joy and tears that carve our way  
We hold on tight, no need to say aaa-aa  
No need to say aaa-aa  

*Outro:*  
Through joy and tears, I’ll find my way  
No need to speak—just feel. Just stay.

No need to speak—just feel. Just stay.
